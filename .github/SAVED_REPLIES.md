## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Saved Replies

- **Consistent Messaging**: When you need to communicate standard processes or policies
- **Time Efficiency**: For frequently asked questions or common scenarios
- **Quality Assurance**: To ensure complete and accurate information in responses
- **Team Coordination**: When multiple team members handle similar issues

### Customization Guidelines

While saved replies provide a foundation, always:

1. **Personalize the greeting** with the contributor's username
2. **Reference specific details** from the issue or PR content  
3. **Add context-specific information** when relevant
4. **Maintain professional and helpful tone** throughout
5. **Include actionable next steps** for the contributor

### Example Usage

Instead of using a saved reply verbatim:
```markdown
Thank you for reporting this issue. We need more information to reproduce the problem.
```

Customize it for the specific case:
```markdown
Hi @username, thank you for reporting this deployment issue with the WordPress automation script. 

To help us reproduce the problem you're experiencing, could you please provide:

- The specific script version you're using
- Your target environment configuration  
- The complete error output from the logs
- Steps you followed before encountering the issue

This information will help us identify the root cause and provide a solution more quickly.
```

- **Offer specific next steps for resolution**

## Maintenance and Updates

1. **Identify the need** based on frequent, similar responses required
2. **Draft the reply** following established patterns and quality standards
3. **Review with team** to ensure accuracy and appropriateness
