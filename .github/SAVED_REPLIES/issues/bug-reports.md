## Security Vulnerability Report

**Use case**: When a bug report describes a potential security vulnerability.

```markdown
Hi @username,

Thank you for reporting this potential security issue. We take security very seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

**Important - Please Read:**

For security vulnerabilities, we have a dedicated process to ensure proper handling:

1. **Do NOT discuss security details in public issues**
2. **Please report security issues privately** to our security team: security@lightspeedwp.com
3. **Include all relevant details** in your private report:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce (proof of concept)
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information for follow-up

**Our Security Process:**
- Security reports are triaged within 24-48 hours
- We'll acknowledge receipt and provide a timeline for investigation
- We coordinate with reporters on disclosure timeline
- Security fixes are prioritized and released as soon as safely possible

**Public Issue Handling:**
I'll convert this public issue to focus on any non-security aspects, or close it if it's purely a security concern. We'll ensure proper credit is given when the security issue is resolved and publicly disclosed.

**Questions?**
If you have questions about our security process, please email security@lightspeedwp.com

Thank you for helping keep our project secure!
