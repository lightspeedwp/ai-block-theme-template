## Branching Strategy (client & product)

Our org-wide Git branching strategy ensures `main` is always deployable, reduces merge risk, and makes PR automation predictable across all repositories. This policy aligns branch names with **Issue Types** and **Projects** so reports and saved searches work cross-repo.

### High-level Rules

- `main` is production-ready at all times
- Optional `develop` for teams that need an integration branch
- Short-lived branches only; open a PR early and keep it small
- Squash merge to preserve a **linear history**; delete branch after merge
- Use prefixes that map cleanly to Issue Types and Project fields

### Branch Naming Convention

**Format:** `{type}/{scope}-{short-title}`  
_lower-case; kebab-case; keep it short._

#### Allowed Branch Prefixes

| Prefix      | Intended work        | Maps to Project Type | Typical Issue Type               |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New capability       | **Feature**          | Feature                          |
| `fix/`      | Defect/regression    | **Bug**              | Bug                              |
| `docs/`     | Docs & comms         | **Documentation**    | Documentation                    |
| `chore/`    | Housekeeping, deps   | **Task**             | Maintenance / Build & CI / Chore |
| `refactor/` | Internal restructure | **Refactor**         | Code Refactor                    |
| `test/`     | Tests only           | **Test Coverage**    | Test Coverage                    |
| `perf/`     | Performance work     | **Performance**      | Performance                      |
| `ci/`       | Workflow changes     | **Build & CI**       | Build & CI                       |
| `release/`  | Release prep         | **Release**          | Release                          |
| `hotfix/`   | Emergency prod fix   | **Release**          | Bug / Release                    |

#### Client Delivery Extensions

For client-specific work, additional prefixes are available:

- `content/` ‚Äî content migration/editing
- `seo/` ‚Äî SEO optimization tasks
- `config/` ‚Äî configuration changes
- `migrate/` ‚Äî data migration tasks
- `qa/` ‚Äî QA/testing specific tasks
- `uat/` ‚Äî User Acceptance Testing

#### Product Development Extensions

For product development, additional prefixes are available:

- `proto/` ‚Äî prototyping/proof-of-concept
- `ds/` ‚Äî design system updates
- `api/` ‚Äî API development
- `schema/` ‚Äî database schema changes
- `telemetry/` ‚Äî analytics/telemetry implementation

### Branch Protection & Enforcement

All repositories should implement:

1. **Protected `main` branch** with required PR reviews
2. **Branch name validation** via CI (see [Branch Name Enforcement Workflow](#branch-name-enforcement))
3. **Squash merge** to maintain linear history
4. **Automatic branch deletion** after merge

### Reference Documentation

_Note: Detailed implementation guidelines are consolidated in this handbook. Previous separate documentation files have been superseded by this centralized reference._

---

## Changelog & Release Automation (client & product)

Automated changelog management and release generation ensures every change is documented and released consistently and traceably. The approach uses GitHub Actions to enforce standards and automate version bumping, changelog updates, and GitHub Releases.

### Pull Request Changelog Requirements

Every PR must include a **structured "Changelog" section** in its description:

```markdown
## Changelog

### Added

- New feature or capability

### Changed

- Modified existing functionality

### Fixed

- Bug fixes and corrections

### Removed

- Deprecated or removed features
```

### Semantic Versioning with Labels

Version bumping is automated based on PR labels:

- **`release: patch`** ‚Üí Patch version bump (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
- **`release: minor`** ‚Üí Minor version bump (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
- **`release: major`** ‚Üí Major version bump (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
- **`BREAKING CHANGE:`** in PR description ‚Üí Major version bump (overrides label)

### Workflow Differences

#### Client Delivery Workflow

- Focuses on traceable releases for client handoffs
- Every merge to `main` triggers a release
- Emphasizes documentation and client communication
- Includes UAT sign-off integration

#### Product Development Workflow

- Emphasizes continuous deployment
- May include package publishing steps
- Supports multiple release channels (alpha, beta, stable)
- Integration with distribution systems

### Reference Documentation

_Implementation details for both client delivery and product development workflows are specified in the sections below._

## Label Automation Strategy

A comprehensive plan to standardize GitHub labels, automate changelogs, and enforce consistent Git branching workflow across LightSpeed's repositories. This strategy supports our Scrumban process and accommodates both design and development tracks.

### Label Governance

#### Centralized Label Families

We manage a unified set of issue/PR labels, grouped into logical "families":

- **Type/Category Labels:** `bug`, `feature`, `task`, `documentation`, `design`
- **Status Labels:** `status: backlog`, `status: todo`, `status: in-progress`, `status: review`, `status: done`
- **Priority Labels:** `priority: low`, `priority: medium`, `priority: high`, `priority: critical`
- **Area Labels:** `area: frontend`, `area: backend`, `area: infrastructure`, `area: design`
- **Release Labels:** `release: patch`, `release: minor`, `release: major`

#### Central Management

Labels are centrally managed via the LightSpeed `.github` repository with:

- Single source-of-truth configuration
- Automated synchronization across repositories
- Consistent naming, descriptions, and colors
- Prevention of label drift

### Automatic Labeling Rules

GitHub Actions automatically apply labels based on:

- **Branch prefixes** (e.g., `feat/` ‚Üí `type: feature`)
- **File paths** (e.g., changes in `/docs/` ‚Üí `area: documentation`)
- **PR content** (e.g., "BREAKING CHANGE" ‚Üí `release: major`)
- **Issue templates** (pre-populated labels based on issue type)

### Project & Milestone Sync

Integration between labels, projects, and milestones:

- Labels trigger project board updates
- Milestone assignment based on release labels
- Cross-repository project synchronization
- Automated progress tracking

### Reference Documentation

_Label strategy and definitions are detailed in the sections below._

---

## Issue Types & PR Labelling

Standardized issue types ensure consistent categorization and automation across all LightSpeed repositories.

### Core Issue Types

### PR Labelling Automation

PRs are automatically labeled based on:

- **Branch prefix** ‚Üí **Issue Type** mapping
- **File changes** ‚Üí **Area** labels
- **PR template** ‚Üí **Status** and **Priority** labels
- **Changelog content** ‚Üí **Release** labels

### Usage Guidelines

- **Every issue/PR** must have exactly **one** Issue Type label
