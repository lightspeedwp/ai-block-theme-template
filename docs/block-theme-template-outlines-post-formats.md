# Block Template Outlines â€” Post Formats (Updated to canonical template parts & patterns)

These outlines describe templates for specific post formats. Each template should follow the standard skeleton (parts/skip-links, parts/header, content, parts/footer) and use the canonical parts and patterns.

## Naming
- Post-format-specific single templates can be named: templates/single-post-{format}.html (e.g., single-post-quote.html).
- Post-format archives are taxonomy/post_format archives: templates/taxonomy-post_format-post-format-{format}.html or templates/taxonomy-post_format.html.

## Templates

- Minimal:

### Taxonomy: post_format archives
- Minimal:

General implementation notes:
- Prefer core blocks for editability.
- Maintain single visible H1 per page; if a format hides visible title, include a visually-hidden H1.
- Expose custom fields used in Query Loops via show_in_rest.
- Use parts/share-actions, parts/loop-default, patterns/post-card, and patterns/author-card variants as needed.

If desired, I can generate ready-to-drop-in templates for all formats that include Template Part blocks referencing the canonical parts.
