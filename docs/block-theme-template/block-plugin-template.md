# Single Block Plugin Template — Directory & Customization Guide

This repository provides a **starter template for building WordPress block plugins**, with mustache placeholders throughout (`{{slug}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{namespace}}`, etc.) for rapid customization. All config and source files are prefilled with placeholders and follow LightSpeed and WordPress coding standards.

## Asset and File Guidance

Each file listed above should be generated with mustache placeholders for project-specific values.  
Refer to the attached example files for formatting, structure, and configuration conventions.

### Key Config and Source Files

- **webpack.config.js**: Uses @wordpress/scripts by default, but includes fallback configuration with mustache placeholders for paths and output.
- **eslint.config.js / .eslintrc**: Follows WordPress and LightSpeed JS standards, uses mustache placeholders in project paths and settings.
- **stylelint.config.js**: Extends @wordpress/stylelint-config.
- **postcss.config.js**: Uses @wordpress/postcss-plugins-preset and autoprefixer.
- **playwright.config.js**: Basic E2E config, extend as needed for your plugin.
- **phpunit.xml, phpcs-baseline.xml**: PHP testing and linting configs, with relevant directories and exclusions.
- **package.json**: All scripts and dependencies must support linting, formatting, build, test, and plugin packaging. Include husky and lint-staged for Git hooks.
- **composer.json**: PHP dependencies for standards and testing.
- **README.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, USAGE.md**: Thorough documentation covering setup, dev workflow, usage, support, and contribution.
- **SUPPORT.md, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Project and community standards.
- **vscode-extensions.txt**: List of recommended VS Code extensions for all contributors.

### Source Files (src/)

- All block source files (`index.js`, `edit.js`, `save.js`, `block.json`, `style.scss`, `editor.scss`) must use mustache placeholders for block meta, text domain, and namespace.
- PHP files (`{{slug}}.php`, `render.php`) must use WordPress standards for escaping and i18n.

## Customization

- To generate a new plugin, replace all mustache placeholders (`{{slug}}`, etc.) with your block’s actual values.
- Every config, source, and documentation file should be customizable.

## Build, Lint, and Test

- Use npm scripts (`start`, `build`, `lint`, `test`, etc.) as shown in package.json.
- Composer scripts for PHP linting and testing.
- Husky and lint-staged should enforce code quality pre-commit and pre-push.
- E2E tests via Playwright, unit tests via Jest and PHPUnit.
- CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions (workflows in `.github/workflows/`).

## VS Code Extensions

- The `vscode-extensions.txt` file lists all recommended extensions for a complete dev experience.  
  All contributors should install these to maintain consistency.
